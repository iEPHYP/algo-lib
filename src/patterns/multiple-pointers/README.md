# Multiple pointers pattern

Creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition. The data should be sorted.
Very efficient for solving problems with minimal space complexity as well.

// TODO: is there any examples or problems where I have to use more than 2 pointers?
