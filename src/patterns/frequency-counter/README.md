# Frequency Counter Pattern

This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values
This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays / strings

This pattern is good to use when you need to compare some items in some way,
where it's enough to confirm that the items' parts frequency counts are equal.
