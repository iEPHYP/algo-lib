# Max Subset Sum with No Adjacent Elements

Write a function that takes in an array of positive integers and returns the maximum sum of non-adjacent elements in the array. If the input array is empty, the function should return 0.

## Concept

A few things to remember about the problem:

The input array includes only positive integers (negative integers would change the solution)
You can not add any two elements to the sum if they are next to each other

## Example

input: [7, 10, 12, 7, 9, 14]
output: 33 === 7 + 12 + 14
